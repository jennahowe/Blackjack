Blackjack
=========

This was the final project for my second year (physics) C++ course. The aim was to demonstrate OOP concepts, and wrap up
everything we covered in the course.

Somehow I did the whole thing without any version control! Happily I know better now, which is why it's on here.

It's also on here so that I can play with it and improve it.

Features:

  - Up to 6 human players, and up to 5 computer players.
  
  - The computer players are all quite simplistic, they each follow the same simple decision algorithm, but with different
    parameters.
    
  - There is also a simple betting mechanism in place.
  
  - Can play as many rounds as you like (until you run out of money).
  
  - You can play either 3:2 blackjack (default) or 6:5 blackjack.
